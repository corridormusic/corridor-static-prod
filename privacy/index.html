By using or visiting the CM Website or using the Applications, you agree to the
collection and use of information in the manner described in this policy. CM shall
have right at any time and without prior notice, at its sole discretion, to revise this
policy. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you by email, by
means of a notice the next time you log in to the CM Website, by means of a
notice on the CM Website homepage or when you next activate the Application.
Such revisions and additions shall be effective immediately upon notice. You are
responsible for reviewing the CM Website or Applications periodically for any
modification to this policy. Any access or use of the CM Website or Applications
by you after notice of modifications to this policy shall constitute and be deemed
to be your agreement to such modifications.
</small></p>

<h2 class="subtitle">THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>

<p class="text"><small>
This policy applies to all information collected on the CM Website, any
information you provide to CM and any information that results from your use of
Applications. You will most likely provide us personal information to us when you
register as a user of CM Website, license and then use the Applications or
participate in certain CM promotions or events. The personal information we may
collect might include: passwords, user names, addresses, email addresses,
phone numbers.
</small></p>

<h2 class="subtitle">MESSAGE AREAS</h2>

<p class="text"><small>
The CM Website or Applications may include message areas that allow users to
post or send information to the CM Website or the Applications. When you post
information to the CM Website or Applications, others can also view that
information. We urge you to exercise caution when providing personally
identifiable information to CM, the CM Website or the Applications.
</small></p>

<h2 class="subtitle">OUR COLLECTION OF YOUR DATA</h2>

<p class="text"><small>
In addition to the personal information you supply, we may collect certain
information to (1) evaluate how visitors, guests, and customers use the CM
Website or the Applications; or (2) provide you with personalized information.
We collect data to make the CM Website and Applications work better for you in
the following ways: to improve the design of the CM Website and Applications, to
provide personalization on the CM Website and Applications and to evaluate the
performance of our marketing programs. The technologies we may use to gather
this non-personal information may include “IP” addresses, “cookies”, browser
detection, “weblogs” and various “geo-location” tools.
</small></p>

<h2 class="subtitle">HOW WE COLLECT AND USE INFORMATION</h2>

<p class="text"><small>
Our primary goal in collecting your information is to provide you with a
personalized, relevant, and positive experience with the CM Website and
Applications.
</small></p>

<p class="text"><small>
You can register on the CM Website or the Applications to receive promotions
and updates, or to be contacted for market research purposes. You can control
your privacy preferences regarding such marketing communications (see the
section below entitled “Your Privacy Preferences”).
</small></p>

<p class="text"><small>
From time to time, you may be invited to participate in optional customer surveys
or promotions, and CM may request that you provide some or all of the above
listed personal information in those surveys or promotions. We use information
collected from surveys and promotions to learn about our customers in order to
improve our services and develop new products and services of interest to our
customers.
</small></p>

<p class="text"><small>
IP addresses define the Internet location of computers and help us better
understand the geographic distribution of our visitors and customers and manage
the performance of the CM Website. Cookies are tiny files placed onto the hard
drive of your computer when you visit the CM Website, so we can immediately
recognize you when you return to the CM Website and deliver content specific to
your interests. You may modify your browser preferences to accept all cookies,
be notified when a cookie is set, or reject all cookies. Please consult your
browser instructions for information on how to modify your choices about
cookies. If you modify your browser preferences, certain features of the CM
Website may not be available to you.
</small></p>

<p class="text"><small>
We may detect the type of web browser you are using to optimize the
performance of the CM Website and to understand the mix of browsers used by
our visitors, guests, and customers. To learn about how people use our site, we
examine weblogs, which show the paths people take through the CM Website
and how long they spend in certain areas.
</small></p>

<p class="text"><small>
The Applications may include the ability to link certain geographical information
made available by us with your physical location. When you use the Applications,
the Applications may know, in very general terms, your current physical location.
To the extent that your physical location can be determined by the Applications,
we may use your location to make available information to you that is relevant
because of your physical location.
</small></p>

<p class="text"><small>
We may also compile certain general information related to your use of the
Website and Applications. You agree that we are authorized to use, reproduce
and generally make such information available to third parties in the aggregate,
provided that your information shall not include personally identifiable information
about you or be attributable to you.
</small></p>

<p class="text"><small>
CM may contract with unaffiliated third parties to provide services such as
website or application hosting, advertising, customer communications, data
analytics and other services. When we do this, we may provide your personally
identifiable information to third parties only to provide those services, and they
are not authorized to use your personally identifiable information for any other
purpose.
</small></p>

<h2 class="subtitle">OUR COMMITMENT TO DATA SECURITY</h2>

<p class="text"><small>
Access to your personal data is limited to authorized CM staff or approved
vendors. Although total security does not exist on the Internet or through mobile
networks, CM shall make commercially reasonable efforts to safeguard the
information that you submit to CM.
</small></p>

<h2 class="subtitle">USE OF THE CM WEBSITE AND APPLICATIONS BY CHILDREN</h2>

<p class="text"><small>
<b>THE CM WEBSITE AND THE APPLICATIONS ARE NOT INTENDED FOR
USE BY CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 13.</b>
</small></p>

<h2 class="subtitle">YOUR PRIVACY PREFERENCES</h2>

<p class="text"><small>
When you sign up as a registered user of the CM Website or Applications you
may begin receiving marketing communications such as e-mail newsletters,
product and service updates and promotions. Our customers generally find this
type of information useful. If you do not want to receive these updates, you must
“opt-out” by unchecking the “Add me to the mailing list” box on the registration
page, or should you choose to opt-out after registering, you can select the
“unsubscribe” link at the bottom of the email and follow the opt-out instructions or
send an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@corridormusic.com">privacy@corridormusic.com</a>.
</small></p>

<h2 class="subtitle">HOW TO ACCESS OR CORRECT YOUR INFORMATION</h2>

<p class="text"><small>
Send CM an email at <a href="mailto:privacy@corridormusic.com">privacy@corridormusic.com</a> if you want to access, review
or correct your personally identifiable information collected by CM. To protect
your privacy and security, CM requires a user ID and password to verify your
identity before granting you the right to access, review or make corrections to
your personally identifiable information.
</small></p>

<h2 class="subtitle">DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION</h2>

<p class="text"><small>
We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as
required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our
rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order or legal process. It is
also possible that CM would sell its business (by merger, acquisition or
otherwise) or sell all or substantially all of its assets. In any transaction of this
kind, customer information, including your personally identifiable information,
may be among the assets that are transferred. If we decide to so transfer your
personally identifiable information, you will be notified by an email sent to the last
know email address in our files, by notice posted on the CM Website or when
you activate the Applications.
</small></p>

<h2 class="subtitle">PRIVACY AND OTHER WEBSITES AND APPLICATIONS</h2>

mobile applications. CM is not responsible for the privacy practices of these other
sites or applications. This policy only applies to information collected by CM.
